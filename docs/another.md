# Chapter 12: Inspection and Maintenance of Clappers

## Introduction

This chapter covers:

* [Background](#background): The various types of clappers, how they are made and suspended within the bell
* [Inspection of Clappers](#inspection-of-clappers): The ways in which clappers can be inspected, both as part of a routine maintenance schedule and to investigate any problems
* [Maintenance](#maintenance): The options for dealing with problems and the level of experience needed to carry them out
* [Final sections cover](#final-section-cover): Other Information relevant to clappers and Further Reading

> With very few exceptions, ringers do not own the bells.
> Permission must be obtained from the relevant authority before any work is carried out - see Permission to Carry out Work.

### Background

A clapper comprises four main components:

* The clapper ball, which strikes the bell
* The flight, which adds mass below the ball to move the centre of gravity nearer to the centre of percussion, reducing bending stresses where the shaft meets the ball
* The crown staple, from which the clapper is suspended
* The shaft, connecting the ball to the crown staple

#### Types of Clapper

There are three main types:

> Steel has been used to make clappers but these are not widely used and are not discussed further here.

* Traditionally, clappers were made from wrought iron.This is an iron alloy of low carbon content with slag inclusions which form a fibrous structure as the material is forged (or ‘wrought’) into a finished product. This material is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion resistant and easily welded. It is an ideal material for producing a clapper. Unfortunately, it is now difficult to source.
* Faced with the difficulty of obtaining wrought iron, ductile iron - also known as spheroidal graphitic (or ‘SG’) cast iron - became the material of use for clappers. This is iron containing a high level of carbon (around 3%). Unlike the more familiar form of cast iron, where the carbon forms inclusions in the shape of flakes, ductile iron includes alloying elements which result in the carbon forming nodular inclusions, giving a tougher material. Being cast, rather than forged, the shape of the casting pattern is important.
* Since 2005, an increasing number of bells are now fitted with wooden shafted clappers. If well designed, these may improve the handling of ‘awkward’ bells and make it easier to raise large bells ‘right’ - see ‘Wooden Shafted Clappers’. ‘Composite clappers’ are also available: these use a man-made material for the shaft.

#### Clapper Suspension - Historical

> This section describes historical clapper designs to allow a steeple keeper to recognise them. The maintenance and repair of such clappers is a specialist task outside the scope of this document.

Up until the mid-19th century, clappers were suspended from a U-shaped wrought iron staple, cast into the crown of a bell during its manufacture. Iron corrodes with time and the corroded staple expands in the crown of the bell, generating stresses which will ultimately lead to cracking of the bell. For this reason. cast-in crown staples must be removed if the bell is to be retained for ringing - see [Removal of a cast-in crown staple](#removal-of-a-cast-in-crown-staple).

The clapper was usually suspended from a cast-in crown staple using a baldrick (or ‘baldric’) mechanism - essentially a leather strap. In the absence (or after the removal) of a cast-in crown staple, a separate bolt passed up through the crown of the bell and the headstock with the clapper suspended from a baldrick or using some wooden clamping mechanism.
