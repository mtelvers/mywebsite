### Background

A clapper comprises four main components:

* The clapper ball, which strikes the bell
* The flight, which adds mass below the ball to move the centre of gravity nearer to the centre of percussion, reducing bending stresses where the shaft meets the ball
* The crown staple, from which the clapper is suspended
* The shaft, connecting the ball to the crown staple
