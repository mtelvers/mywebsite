### Background

A clapper comprises four main components:

* The clapper ball, which strikes the bell
* The flight, which adds mass below the ball to move the centre of gravity nearer to the centre of percussion, reducing bending stresses where the shaft meets the ball
* The crown staple, from which the clapper is suspended
* The shaft, connecting the ball to the crown staple

#### Types of Clapper

There are three main types:

> Steel has been used to make clappers but these are not widely used and are not discussed further here.

* Traditionally, clappers were made from wrought iron.This is an iron alloy of low carbon content with slag inclusions which form a fibrous structure as the material is forged (or ‘wrought’) into a finished product. This material is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion resistant and easily welded. It is an ideal material for producing a clapper. Unfortunately, it is now difficult to source.
* Faced with the difficulty of obtaining wrought iron, ductile iron - also known as spheroidal graphitic (or ‘SG’) cast iron - became the material of use for clappers. This is iron containing a high level of carbon (around 3%). Unlike the more familiar form of cast iron, where the carbon forms inclusions in the shape of flakes, ductile iron includes alloying elements which result in the carbon forming nodular inclusions, giving a tougher material. Being cast, rather than forged, the shape of the casting pattern is important.
* Since 2005, an increasing number of bells are now fitted with wooden shafted clappers. If well designed, these may improve the handling of ‘awkward’ bells and make it easier to raise large bells ‘right’ - see ‘Wooden Shafted Clappers’. ‘Composite clappers’ are also available: these use a man-made material for the shaft.

#### Clapper Suspension - Historical

> This section describes historical clapper designs to allow a steeple keeper to recognise them. The maintenance and repair of such clappers is a specialist task outside the scope of this document.

Up until the mid-19th century, clappers were suspended from a U-shaped wrought iron staple, cast into the crown of a bell during its manufacture. Iron corrodes with time and the corroded staple expands in the crown of the bell, generating stresses which will ultimately lead to cracking of the bell. For this reason. cast-in crown staples must be removed if the bell is to be retained for ringing - see [Removal of a cast-in crown staple](#removal-of-a-cast-in-crown-staple).

The clapper was usually suspended from a cast-in crown staple using a baldrick (or ‘baldric’) mechanism - essentially a leather strap. In the absence (or after the removal) of a cast-in crown staple, a separate bolt passed up through the crown of the bell and the headstock with the clapper suspended from a baldrick or using some wooden clamping mechanism.

#### Modern Independent Clapper Assemblies

In modern installations, the clapper is suspended from an independent crown staple, as shown in [annotated photo], passing up through the crown of the bell and the headstock. Working down from the top, the component parts are:

* A fixing nut at the top of the headstock. There are several possibilities for this:
  * The most common is a castellated nut held in place with a split pin. Stainless steel split pins are preferred to avoid corrosion and they may need to be replaced after removal.
  * A plain nut with a split pin above - the nut may work loose but should not come off completely.
  * A nut plus a locknut - see Fig. A
  * A nut with a sacrificial plastic insert - this type must be replaced every time the nut is removed.
* Proprietary locking nuts with a metallic spring section that clamps to the thread.
* A steel washer between the nut and the top of the headstock.
* The part of the staple bolt within the headstock is normally of square section.
* Within the crown of the bell is the crown staple washer, made of leather or fibre. When the crown staple nut is tightened, this helps to lock the crown staple in position within the bell. This is particularly important where the inside of the crown of the bell is rough - for example where the bell has been quarter turned.
* At the bottom of the crown staple is a clevis fitting comprising a U-shaped yoke with a pivot pin supporting the clapper - described in the following section.

#### Pivot Pin and Clapper Bushes

The U-shaped clevis has two holes to accommodate a pivot pin. One hole and one end of the pin are threaded. After insertion, the threaded end of the pin protrudes through the clevis and is secured by a locknut - possibly a castellated one with a split pin. In most modern designs, the other end of the pin has a machined flat to allow an adjustable or C-spanner to hold the pin while the locknut is tightened. [Photo] This forms a ‘headless bolt’ to avoid stressing the clevis. If a bolt head is present, care must be taken not to overtighten as this could crack a cast staple or bend a steel one.

> Some designs of wooden shafted clappers have a ball bearing suspension. This is outside the scope of this document.

The top end of the clapper has a hole through which the pivot pin passes, lined with a bush. Various types of bush may be encountered:

Traditionally, clapper bushes were made of lignum vitae. This is a dense wood (it sinks in water) containing oils which provide some natural lubrication. It is ideal as a bearing material and has been used for bearings in hydro-electric plants and nuclear submarines. Unfortunately, the source trees are now regarded as ‘Near Threatened’ making further use of this material unsustainable. If worn lignum vitae bushes are encountered, they must be replaced - this is outside the scope of this document.
Clapper bushes made from lignum vitae required additional lubrication, either by a screw cap lubricator of the ‘Stauffer’ type or a grease nipple. Although more modern types of metal or plastic bushes may require no lubrication some bell hangers still provide grease nipples or similar. On balance, a method of lubrication is preferable but the benefit of retrospective fitting may be small.
Modern types of clapper bush are:
Oil impregnated sintered phosphor bronze bushes.
Nylon bushes were used but experienced the problem of swelling when damp or at elevated temperature. Such bushes are rarely fitted now but need not be replaced if performing satisfactorily. If necessary, the swelling problem can be rectified by careful reaming.
Clappers are commonly now fitted with bushes made from a thin TUFNOL tube backed by rubber. (TUFNOL is a proprietary laminated material impregnated with phenolic resin).

####  Clapper Centring Pins (‘Twiddle Pins’)

While not strictly part of the clapper, it is appropriate to mention these here.

Most modern rings of bells with cast iron or fabricated steel headstocks have clapper centring pins fitted - usually known as ‘Twiddle Pins’. There is clearance where the crown staple passes through the bottom of the headstock and the crown of the bell and twiddle pins allow the crown staple to be positioned in the centre of the bell. There is a twiddle pin on either side of the headstock (see Fig. A), each pin comprising a bolt which locates against the generally square section of the staple. The crown staple can be positioned by slackening one pin and tightening the other. Locknuts on each pin allow the pins to be locked in place when the process is complete.

The use of twiddle pins to correct an odd-struck bell is described in [Odd-Struck Bells](odd-struck-bells).

### Inspection of Clappers

This Section deals with initial and regular inspections of clappers. Routine inspection and maintenance should be carried out in accordance with a schedule - see Maintenance Schedule - and results of all inspections, including issues raised and how they were resolved, should be recorded.

For both practical and safety reasons, the inspection and any subsequent maintenance must be carried out by at least two people, taking account of Health & Safety Requirements. The Lead Inspector should have a knowledge of the construction of clappers, as set out earlier, and should have demonstrated competence by carrying out at least one inspection under the supervision of an experienced Inspector. The inspections described here can be carried out by a local Inspector and helpers on the more modern independent crown staple designs; inspections on the older types of clapper suspension may require assistance from more experienced personnel.

The procedure for inspection is as follows:

1. Standing in the pit, swing the clapper to check for squealing or grinding noises. It should swing smoothly and noiselessly. If not, this could indicate problems with the clapper bush. If the clapper has provision for lubrication this should be used.
2. Check the clapper is swinging ‘true’ - that is, the axes of rotation of the bell and the clapper are parallel. This can be checked by loosely holding the clapper vertical while an assistant swings the bell through a small angle. If the clapper is not true it will move slightly sideways as the bell swings. Correction of this problem is described in Clapper not swinging true.
3. If this is a first inspection, assess the extent of the clapper impact area on the inside of the bell. If elongated this indicates wear of the clapper bush.
4. If the bell has a wooden clapper, this is a good time to check the tightness of the bolts securing the shaft to the clapper ball and the top fitting.
5. Check the movement of the clapper by attempting to lift the clapper vertically while an assistant holds the crown staple nut lightly (if twiddle pins are present, slacken one of them first). On a well-maintained bell, there should be no vertical movement of the crown staple nut.
6. There are two main reasons why movement might occur:
  * The nut may have worked loose. This is unlikely with a castellated nut and split pin or a proprietary type of locknut but might occur with other types of nut. The corrective action is described in Correcting loose crown staple nut.
  * The crown staple washer may be damaged.
7. With the crown staple tight in the crown of the bell, there may still be some small vertical movement arising from play in the clapper bush. This can be investigated further by checking the sideways movement of the clapper - sometimes termed ‘clapper roll’. This is a sensitive measurement as a small movement in the bush is magnified by the length of the clapper. Clapper roll is measured most easily by standing in front of the bell with the clapper pulled to touch the rim. The total extent (left to right) of sideways movement can then be measured. The amount of roll should be checked at each inspection to provide a history of bush wear and to give warning of the need for re-bushing. As a guide, clapper roll over 20mm is warning of a need to plan for re-bushing and over 50mm requires immediate attention. A sudden large increase in clapper roll may indicate breakage of the pivot pin.

> If the bells have not been inspected for a long time, wear of the bush will be revealed by an elongated impact area on the bell

It will be necessary to remove the clapper to investigate (a) noise from the swinging clapper, (b) excessive clapper roll, or (c) possible damage to the crown staple washer or pivot pin - clapper removal is described in Removal and replacement of a clapper.

### Maintenance

> When working under small bells it may be necessary to remove the slider (if present) to provide better access. You MUST check it has been replaced correctly when the work is complete.

#### Removal of a cast-in crown staple

Removal of a cast-in crown staple must be carried out by a professional bell hanger, commonly within their workshop. Note that this work will require a faculty (see Permission to Carry out Work).

#### Clapper not swinging true

The procedure is:

1. Slacken off one twiddle pin if present
2. Assistant just slackens the crown staple nut
3. Inspector (in the bell pit) pulls the clapper to the side of the bell and rotates it to the central position
4. Inspector loosely holds the clapper vertical and checks for sideways movement as assistant swings the bell through a small angle
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the Inspector is satisfied that the clapper is swinging true
6. Inspector holds the clapper in the correct position against the edge of the bell while the assistant tightens the crown staple nut and, if fitted, the twiddle pin
7. Repeat step 4 to check that the clapper is still swinging true - over-enthusiastic re-tightening of the crown staple nut may rotate the crown staple.

Record a note to check again at the next inspection interval. The clapper will need removal for further investigation if the problem recurs.

#### Correcting loose crown staple nut

As in replacement of the clapper described below.

#### Removal and replacement of a clapper

> Using local effort to remove and replace a clapper is valuable, since it saves a bell hanger the time and expense of travel to do this small part of the work.

Removal and replacement of a clapper is within the capability of an average steeple keeper, even if rectification of any problems require specialist services.

1. If necessary, remove the split pin. Slightly loosen the crown staple nut, ideally using the correct size spanner, although a large adjustable spanner is a possible alternative. This may require some effort if the nut was over-tightened in the past.
2. If twiddle pins are present, slacken one.
3. Using tape or a marker pen, mark the ground pulley side of the clapper and the crown staple. This is to ensure that the clapper is replaced in the original orientation.
4. An assistant stands in the pit ready to support the clapper while the Inspector removes the crown staple nut. The Inspector must warn the assistant just before the nut comes off the thread. The nut and washer are replaced for safe keeping on the crown staple after removal.

With the assembly removed, any problems with a worn bush, failure of a pivot pin or a damaged washer will usually be obvious. Any problems can be rectified either by a local engineering specialist or a bell hanger.

Replacement of the clapper follows the reverse procedure, ensuring that:

1. The clapper is replaced in the original orientation, checking it is swinging true - see above
2. The twiddle pin, if present, is tightened. This is done with the crown staple nut just tight (‘nipped up’ seems to be the technical term)
3. The crown staple nut is tightened. A rule of thumb is to use only a moderate force applied to a 10" (25cm) spanner.
4. A final check is carried out to ensure the clapper is swinging true

Finally, details of the work carried out are recorded for future reference.

### Other Information

#### Odd-Struck Bells

Ideally, the time it takes for a bell to strike after being pulled off at handstroke should be equal to the time at backstroke. Many ringers will have visited towers where they are warned that a certain bell is “a bit slow at handstroke” or something similar. But this should not be the case for a modern bell with the clapper hanging in the centre of the bell at rest.

A bell that is noticeably odd-struck and has twiddle pins can be corrected as follows:

1. With the bell down, pull up the rope and secure it to take the weight of the rope off the wheel. The bell should now be at bottom dead centre of its rotation. If possible, check this with a straight edge and a spirit level across the mouth of the bell. (A bell on plain bearings may need nudging for it to settle at bottom dead centre.)
2. Slightly loosen the crown staple nut.
3. Standing facing the bell, touch the end of a tape measure against the striking surface on the clapper ball (taking care not to move the clapper) and read the measurement to the lip of the bell.
4. Repeat this on the opposite side (it helps to have one person on each side).
5. If the readings are different, slacken one twiddle pin and tighten the other.
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the two measurements are equal, ideally to within 1mm.
7. Re-tighten the crown staple nut and re-instate the bell rope.

If twiddle pins are not present, the recommendation is to place a tapered washer (or a half-washer) under the crown of the bell. But this is outside the scope of this document.

Electronic devices are available for measuring odd-struckness - as described in [Odd-struckness and Swing Periods](#odd-struckness-and-swing-periods). It may be possible to find someone able to offer this as a service - perhaps in your local Guild or Association. Such a device can offer useful data on the swing periods of bells and the comparison between all bells in the ring - see also in [Odd-struckness and Swing Periods](#odd-struckness-and-swing-periods). While outside the scope of this document, this may be worth investigating as a way of dealing with problems in striking for some rings of bells.

#### Clapper Breakage

A broken clapper (see Fig. B) is not something that a local steeple keeper can deal with. The failure usually results from a fatigue crack initiated from a surface or internal defect. It is to be hoped that such failures may become less common with better designs of SG clappers.

| ![IMG_0699-edited.jpg](IMG_0699-edited.jpg) |

The steeple keeper can play a part by removing the remains of the broken clapper and by installing the new or repaired one.

> In the event of a broken clapper, the steeple keeper must check all parts of the installation for any consequential damage caused by the flying clapper.

#### Worn Clapper Ball

Wear on the striking face of the clapper ball should be checked during routine maintenance. If a substantial flat surface has developed this is a job for a bell hanger, although the steeple keeper can assist by removing and replacing the clapper. The bell hanger may be able to twist and re-forge the shaft of a wrought iron clapper to present a new striking face.

#### Bell going up Wrong

Some bells are prone to going up ‘wrong’. That is, the clapper is on the lower (wrong) side of the bell when it is set at handstroke after raising. For some bells, it may be difficult to set the bell when this occurs. This depends on the design of bell and clapper - more specifically, on (a) the distance between the two axes of rotation of bell and clapper, and (b) the low amplitude swing periods of the bell and clapper. As a rough guide, the low amplitude swing period of the clapper should be at least 90% that of the bell.

Rectification is a job for specialists, although replacement with a wooden shafted clapper may help.

### Further Reading

#### Permission to Carry out Work

For towers within the jurisdiction of the Church of England, the churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council are responsible for the maintenance of the tower and bells. Their consent should be obtained for all work on the bell installation and they must obtain a Faculty where appropriate. The latest (2019) Faculty Jurisdiction Rules are available online [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1184/made). See also the Stewardship & Management Guidance Note: Backhurst, R and Hodge, A. Changes to the Church of England Faculty Jurisdiction Rules - A Guide for Bell Ringers (2020), available online [here](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SM_Faculty_Changes_2020_Ver_1.pdf).

Different arrangements will apply in other jurisdictions within the UK and world-wide. Local advice must be sought.

#### Health & Safety Requirements

Advice on risk minimisation in a tower is included in the Stewardship & Management Guidance Note on "Tower Safety & Risk Assessment" available online [here](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SM_Risk-Assessment_2020_Ver_1.pdf).

Personal protection should include work boots with steel toecaps and good ankle support, gloves, and head protection. A ‘Bump Cap’ may be preferable to the traditional safety helmet (‘hard hat’) when working in confined conditions but note that a bump cap is not intended to provide protection from falling objects.

#### Wooden Shafted Clappers

Bernard Taylor provides a history of the development of wooden shafted clappers in: “Wheeler’s Wooden Wallopers”. The Ringing World 2020(5721): 1258-1261. Several other suppliers now provide their own designs.
